In Blender 4.x Object Mode, there are several default pie menus accessible via keyboard shortcuts. Here are some of the most common ones:

1.  **Viewport Pie Menu:** `~` (Tilde/Grave Accent)
    *   Allows you to quickly switch between different views like Top, Front, Right, Camera view, etc.

2.  **Shading Pie Menu:** `Z`
    *   Used to change the viewport shading (e.g., Wireframe, Solid, Material Preview, Rendered).

3.  **Mode Pie Menu:** `Ctrl + Tab`
    *   Lets you switch between different object interaction modes, such as Object Mode, Edit Mode, Sculpt Mode, Vertex Paint, etc.

4.  **Pivot Point Pie Menu:** `.` (Period)
    *   This menu allows you to change the pivot point for transformations (e.g., Bounding Box Center, 3D Cursor, Individual Origins, Median Point, Active Element). This is mentioned in discussions about pivot manipulation on [Blender Artists](https://blenderartists.org/t/moving-the-pivot/1465869).

5.  **Transform Orientation Pie Menu:** `,` (Comma)
    *   Used to switch the transform orientation (e.g., Global, Local, Normal, Gimbal, View).

6.  **Snap Pie Menu:** `Shift + S`
    *   Provides options for snapping objects and the 3D cursor (e.g., Selection to Grid, Cursor to Selected, Selection to Cursor). The 3D cursor, often positioned using this menu, is crucial for setting origins, as also discussed on [Blender Artists](https://blenderartists.org/t/moving-the-pivot/1465869).

7.  **Proportional Editing Falloff Pie Menu:** `Shift + O`
    *   This pie menu is available when Proportional Editing is active (toggled with `O`). It allows you to change the falloff shape for the proportional editing influence.

So, there are at least these 7 common default pie menus you can use in Object Mode. Keep in mind that some add-ons might introduce their own pie menus.
