## Subdirectory Specifications

### design/
**Purpose**: Store technical design documents and API specifications before implementation begins.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory typically contains design documents that outline how systems should work before implementation. Common usage patterns include API interface specifications, system architecture diagrams, technical decision documentation with rationales, data models and schema definitions, protocol specifications, and security considerations. Projects might use this space to document constraints, trade-offs, and future extensibility plans. The actual content and organization depends on the project's specific design workflow and documentation needs.

### plans/
**Purpose**: Contain implementation roadmaps, project planning, and development coordination.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory commonly holds planning documents that organize development work over time. Projects often store feature development plans with task breakdowns, sprint planning and milestone definitions, resource allocation estimates, risk assessments, and release planning schedules. Teams might use this space for coordination workflows, timeline tracking, and scope management. The planning approach and documentation style can vary based on project methodology, team size, and organizational preferences.

### hints/
**Purpose**: Provide programming tutorials, development guides, and best practice documentation.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory serves as a knowledge base for development guidance and solutions. Projects commonly store technology-specific tutorials, development best practices, troubleshooting guides, tool usage instructions, and framework-specific patterns. Teams might document recurring solutions, performance optimization techniques, and quick reference materials. The content could include code examples, workflow tips, and practical demonstrations. What goes here depends on the team's learning needs and the technologies being used.

### summaries/
**Purpose**: Maintain project experience repository and knowledge base.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory captures accumulated project wisdom and experience. Teams often document lessons learned from development challenges, architecture evolution histories, performance optimization discoveries, and successful integration patterns. Projects might store retrospectives, technology evaluations, and institutional knowledge that helps preserve context across team changes. The format and depth of summaries can vary from brief notes to detailed case studies, depending on what proves most valuable for the team.

### tasks/
**Purpose**: Coordinate specific development requests between humans and AI assistants.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory facilitates communication between human developers and AI assistants about specific work items. Common content includes development task specifications, feature requirements, bug reports, enhancement requests, research assignments, and maintenance tasks. Projects might structure these with acceptance criteria, priority levels, and links to related documentation. The organization could range from simple task lists to detailed specifications, depending on project complexity and collaboration needs.

### logs/
**Purpose**: Maintain development history and session continuity for AI assistants.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory preserves context and history for ongoing AI-assisted development. Projects commonly store AI assistant session summaries, decision-making processes, debugging session outcomes, and project evolution timelines. Teams might document significant development milestones, learning progressions, and context information that helps maintain continuity across multiple sessions. The logging approach can vary from detailed transcripts to high-level summaries, depending on what provides the most value for maintaining project context.

### refcode/
**Purpose**: Store reference implementations and example code from external sources.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory holds external code examples and reference implementations that inform project development. Common content includes example implementations from similar projects, library usage patterns, best practice demonstrations, and code snippets for common operations. Projects might organize content using subdirectories for different technologies, include git submodules for complete repositories, or store framework-specific patterns. Teams should maintain clear attribution for external sources and document relevance to current project needs while respecting licensing requirements.

### tools/
**Purpose**: House custom development utilities and project-specific automation scripts.

**Recommended Usage**:
This directory contains project-specific utilities and automation scripts that support development workflows. Common content includes code generation tools, build and deployment automation, data processing utilities, testing helpers, and documentation generators. Projects might organize tools by functionality and include usage documentation for each utility. The tools can range from simple scripts to complex automation systems, depending on project needs and team preferences. Teams often share useful tools across similar projects while maintaining them as requirements evolve.

## Implementation Requirements
