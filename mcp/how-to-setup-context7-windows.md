see https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/3135

instead of installing through the cline mcp server gui I prompted cline with this:

I want to install context7 mcp server. however I want you to take note of the fact that this is the 5th try to install this mcp server. so please be careful about every step and mindful of what needs to be done exactly to solve issues comming up with this task.

It solved the issue and i let it compile a guide just for fun and maybe documentation or for the next iteration of AI

Guide: Installing the context7 MCP Server on Windows (Addressing Common Issues)
This guide outlines the steps taken to successfully install the context7 MCP server on a Windows environment, specifically addressing issues encountered during previous attempts.

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed on your system.
Git installed on your system.
PowerShell as your terminal.
Installation Steps:

Navigate to the MCP Servers Directory:
Open your PowerShell terminal and change the directory to where MCP servers are typically stored. Replace <YourUsername> with your actual Windows username.

cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\Cline\MCP
Clean and Clone the Repository:
Due to previous installation attempts potentially leaving an incomplete or empty directory, the existing context7-mcp directory was removed before cloning the fresh repository. The repository was cloned from https://github.com/upstash/context7-mcp.

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force context7-mcp; git clone https://github.com/upstash/context7-mcp
(Note: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force is the PowerShell equivalent of rmdir /s /q used in Command Prompt. The semicolon ; is used to chain commands on a single line in PowerShell.)

Navigate into the Cloned Directory:
Change your current directory to the newly cloned context7-mcp folder:

cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\Cline\MCP\context7-mcp
Install Dependencies:
The project uses package.json for dependency management. Although a bun.lock file was present, the bun command was not available on the system. Therefore, npm was used to install the required packages.

npm install
Build the Project:
The build script in package.json compiles the TypeScript code. The original build script included a chmod command to set file permissions, which is not a standard command on Windows and caused the build to fail partially. The core compilation with tsc was successful, and the resulting dist/index.js file is executable by Node.js without the chmod step.

npm run build
(Note: The error regarding chmod is expected on Windows and does not prevent the server from running via Node.js.)

Configure MCP Settings:
The MCP settings file (C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json) was updated to include the configuration for the context7-mcp server. The existing entry was modified to correctly point the command to node and the args to the full path of the built executable (C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\Cline\MCP\context7-mcp\dist\index.js).

The updated configuration in cline_mcp_settings.json is:

"github.com/upstash/context7-mcp": {
  "autoApprove": [],
  "disabled": false,
  "timeout": 60,
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\Documents\\Cline\\MCP\\context7-mcp\\dist\\index.js"
  ],
  "transportType": "stdio"
}
Verification:

To verify that the context7 MCP server is running, check the "Connected MCP Servers" section in your environment details within Cline. You should see "github.com/upstash/context7-mcp" listed there.

Differences Compared to a "Usual" Installation (Potential Issues):

Initial Directory State: The context7-mcp directory in the MCP servers location was initially found to be empty or inaccessible via standard listing commands, necessitating its removal and a fresh clone.
PowerShell Command Chaining: The use of PowerShell required using semicolons (;) instead of && for chaining commands on a single line.
Package Manager: Although bun.lock was present, npm was used for dependency installation because the bun executable was not found on the system.
chmod Command Failure: The chmod command in the build script failed on the Windows environment. This step was safely bypassed as Node.js can execute the built script directly.
MCP Settings Configuration: The existing MCP settings entry for context7-mcp had to be corrected to use node as the command and provide the explicit path to the built dist/index.js file as an argument, rather than just using "context7-mcp" as the command.
This concludes the installation process for the context7 MCP server based on the steps taken and issues resolved.
